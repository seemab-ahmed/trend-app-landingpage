ISTRUZIONI PER CONFIGURARE GOOGLE APPS SCRIPT:

1. Vai su Google Drive e crea un nuovo Google Sheet
2. Rinomina il foglio in "Demo Requests"
3. Aggiungi le intestazioni: Data | Ora | Email
4. Vai su Extensions > Apps Script
5. Sostituisci il codice con questo script:

function doPost(e) {
  try {
    Logger.log('Inizio elaborazione richiesta');
    
    // Abilita CORS
    var headers = {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type'
    };

    // Verifica se abbiamo ricevuto dei dati
    if (!e || !e.postData) {
      Logger.log('Nessun oggetto evento o postData');
      return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({
        'status': 'error',
        'message': 'No data received'
      }))
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON)
      .setHeaders(headers);
    }

    // Log dei dati ricevuti
    Logger.log('Dati ricevuti: ' + JSON.stringify(e));
    Logger.log('Post data: ' + JSON.stringify(e.postData));
    
    const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
    const data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);
    
    Logger.log('Dati parsati: ' + JSON.stringify(data));
    
    // Verifica che i dati necessari siano presenti
    if (!data.date || !data.time || !data.email) {
      throw new Error('Dati mancanti nel payload');
    }
    
    sheet.appendRow([
      data.date,
      data.time,
      data.email
    ]);
    
    Logger.log('Riga aggiunta con successo');
    
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({
      'status': 'success',
      'message': 'Data added successfully'
    }))
    .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON)
    .setHeaders(headers);
    
  } catch (error) {
    Logger.log('Errore: ' + error.toString());
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({
      'status': 'error',
      'message': error.toString()
    }))
    .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON)
    .setHeaders(headers);
  }
}

// Aggiungi questa funzione per testare che lo script sia attivo
function doGet(e) {
  return ContentService.createTextOutput('Service is running');
}

6. Fai clic su Deploy > New deployment
7. Scegli "Web app"
8. Imposta:
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
9. Fai clic su "Deploy"
10. Copia l'URL generato
11. Sostituisci YOUR_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL nello js/script.js con l'URL copiato

NOTA SULLA SICUREZZA:
- Il deployment è pubblico per semplicità
- Per maggiore sicurezza, considera:
  * Aggiungere validazione lato server
  * Implementare rate limiting
  * Aggiungere un token di autenticazione
  * Limitare l'accesso a domini specifici

 // FAQs Js here
